# Full Stack JVM & JS App 

The template can be found here [Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/).

Additional Info : [Kotlin/JS State Hooks](https://dev.to/skalabledev/kotlinjs-and-state-hooks-2426)

To start the server run :
````
    ./gradlew run
````
The command will get stuck at 95% (atleast on my machine) however it should be running

To view the application use a web browser to navigate to:
````
    https://localhost:8080
````

Here's an image of a sleeping cat :)
